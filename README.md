# WindowsApp

This is my first project in C# using the .NET platform. The main goal of this project is to learn C# and .NET, while creating a simple Windows application that connects to the API of the ChatGPT model family, specifically the newly released GPT-3.5-Turbo.

## Background

I created this project as part of my job interview preparation, as I am interested in a job that requires proficiency in C# and .NET. I hope to gain hands-on experience with these tools and improve my skills as a developer.


## Project Overview

The project is an educational tool that will sends prompts to the ChatGPT model and processes the response, displaying it in a Windows application. The prompts will be pre-made in advance, and users can interact with the application using buttons to generate different prompts and responses.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET platform
- ChatGPT API

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine, matching the version specified in the TargetFramework (in this case, net7.0-windows). You can download the SDK from the official [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

2. Install the [C# extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp), which provides support for C# debugging and IntelliSense.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio Code.

2. If necessary, run `dotnet restore` in the terminal to download the required NuGet packages, including the OpenAI package. In most cases, this step is automatically performed by the build system, but it's good to know in case you encounter any issues with missing dependencies.

3. You're all set! You can now run the application through the debugger in Visual Studio Code by pressing F5 or clicking the "Run" button in the top menu.

## Future Work

In the future, I hope to add more features to this project, such as user-generated prompts and the ability to save and export responses. I also plan to continue improving my skills in C# and .NET.
