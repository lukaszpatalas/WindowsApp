# WindowsApp

This is my first project in C# using the .NET platform. The main goal of this project is to learn C# and .NET, while creating a simple Windows application that connects to the API of the ChatGPT model family, specifically the newly released GPT-3.5-Turbo.

## Background

I created this project as part of my job interview preparation, as I am interested in a job that requires proficiency in C# and .NET. I hope to gain hands-on experience with these tools and improve my skills as a developer.

## Project Overview

The project is an educational tool that will sends prompts to the ChatGPT model and processes the response, displaying it in a Windows application. The prompts will be pre-made in advance, and users can interact with the application using buttons to generate different prompts and responses.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET platform
- ChatGPT API

## Future Work

In the future, I hope to add more features to this project, such as user-generated prompts and the ability to save and export responses. I also plan to continue improving my skills in C# and .NET.
